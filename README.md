# Assignment_1-Lee_Rainwater
## What I hope to learn from this class
1. How to actually deploy models/stuff to the cloud in a way that is useful
2. More in-depth use of Git (I know the very basics; I mainly need to learn enough to not be so dangerous.)
3. If I learn any more about Tensorflow, that will be gravy.
